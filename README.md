## Usage

## Features

- Supports various changepoint models (two-parameter, three-parameter, four-parameter, five-parameter)
- Generates changepoint coordinates
- Handles time series data analysis

## Future Work

- [] Ensure that pydantic v2 is being used and is compatible with the entire package
- [] Ensure PEP 484 compliancy. Make sure everything has a specified type.
- [] Put up some badges on this readme to show relevant information about this package.
- [] [Use Github Actions to develop a Python workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-python)
